# Game Day Attendance Prediction


- Lucas Oil Stadium has a capacity of 67,000 expandable to over 70,000 with about 250 sections. Forecasting fan attendance is not only vital to ensure that the game at Lucas Oil Stadium is properly supported (i.e. staffs, F&B, etc.) but it also strengthens club affinity for future ticket purchases. 

- There were about 18 events in the last 2 years, with an average attendance of 77%
- Attendance of each game fluctuates rapidly and depends on various factors
  - Min attendance - 49%
  - Max attendance - 89%

- Hence, lucas oil stadium team struggles to predict the attendance as the pattern is very inconsistent

Understanding the important factors driving attendance and taking steps based on the predicted occupancy will help us yield the expected benefits. In this project, we will forecast attendance of the game using ML model.
